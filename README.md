# various_small_scripts
A collection of smaller scripts that were used to accomplish a variety of tasks. Below is a list and summary of each script in the repository.

- disjointed_file_concatenation.py:
	A script that was used to join together a continuous stream of data sets produced by dozens of different individuals.
	The data often came with small alterations to column headers, and with reordered columns, so the script is designed to flexibly determine what goes where.

- school_geo_calculations.ipynb:
	A script that performed a set of geospatial equations designed to model distances between all schools in Australia and format them in a manner that could be displayed in a Tableau workbook.
	It essentially functions as a simple pipeline for repeated use, and has been deployed several times in practice.
	All data has been obfuscated and then shuffled before upload for privacy reasons. No data can be traced correctly to schools.
